    "### Introduction:\n",
    "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a North American professional basketball league consisting of 2 conferences. Each conference has 3 divisions, and each division has 5 teams. The NBA is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is regarded as the highest level men's professional basketball tournament in the world. We are going to use a dataset from \"basketball-reference.com\", which provides precise statistics for all players. In this project, we are going to investigate the relationship between the players' salary and the following variables during the 2022-23 season: \n",
    "* Position\n",
    "* Age = age pf players\n",
    "* GP = number of games played\n",
    "* GS = number of games started \n",
    "* Total Minutes = total minutes played\n",
    "* PTS = points\n",
    "* eFG% = effective field goal percentage\n",
    "* TS% = true shooting percentage\n",
    "* WS = win shares\n",
    "* VORP = value over replacement player"

    "### Methods:\n",
    "In the 2022-2023 season dataset, the following variables will be selected: \n",
    "\n",
    "    -Age: Often indicates a player's experience and professional maturity \n",
    "\n",
    "    -Games Played: Evidences a player's reliability \n",
    "\n",
    "    -Total Minutes Played: Indicates a player's significance to the team \n",
    "\n",
    "    -True Shooting Percent: Measures a player's ability to score efficiently \n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of these variables rests on the hypothesis that they determine a player's worth and, consequently, their salary. Observations with missing data will be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplots will illustrate the relationship between each variable and the player's salary, aiding in the visualization of potential correlations. If any variable shows weak correlation, it will be replaced. The main modeling technique will be multiple regression, with cross-validation ensuring model robustness. Finally, this model will aid in estimating a retired player's current earnings based on their past performances. \n",
